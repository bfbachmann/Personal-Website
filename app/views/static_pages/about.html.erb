		<h4> About Me </h4>

		<p class="intro"> Hi! My name is Bruno Bachmann, thanks for checking out my website. I am a Computer Engineer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Programming is my passion. I love everything from game development, modelling and animation to web development. I especially enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and pursuing personal projects in these areas during whatever free time I can spare.

	<h4> About This Website </h4>

	<p class="intro"> I had two main goals in mind while developing this website. The first was to learn Ruby on Rails (which I love and would recommend to pretty much any programmer). The second was to develop a website that would act as my second resum√© of sorts. I feel that in the software development industry it is important to demonstrate to prospective employers that you are in fact capable of building and deploying applications. </p>
