		<h4> About This Website </h4>

		<p class="intro"> I had two main goals in mind while developing this website. The first was to learn Ruby on Rails (which I love and would recommend to pretty much any programmer). The second was to develop a website that would act as my second resum√© of sorts. I feel that in the software industry it is important to demonstrate to prospective employers that you are in fact capable of building and deploying applications. </p>
